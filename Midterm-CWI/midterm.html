            <p>I decided to take this class because it was part of the classes I need to satisfy in order to gain a major degree in communication design. This class is also a pre-resquitive to other higher level classes that I need in order to graduate. I have also taken this class because I have an intereste in web design and I would like to become a better and much more effective coder, this will enable me to have a better advantage in todays design industry, where the internet is the a place where the world communicates.</p>
